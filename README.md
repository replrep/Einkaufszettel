## Einkaufszettel

This is a minimalistic kotlin/jetpack/android app to note down stuff
for your next shopping trip. It can register items in two levels, one
for frequently needed things (like eggs or milk), one for less
frequently needed things (like socks). Registered items can be put on
the actual shopping list with a single tap. There is also support for
remembering one-time things that do not need to be registered
persistently.


 *Please do not try to use it yet, it is still in a pre-alpha
 non-functioning state.*
