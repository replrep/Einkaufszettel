## Einkaufszettel

This is a minimalistic kotlin/jetpack/android app to note down stuff
for your next shopping trip ('Einkaufszettel' is German for
tiny-scrap-of-paper-used-for-a-list-of-things-to-buy). It can register
items in two levels, one for frequently needed things (like eggs or
milk), one for less frequently needed things (like socks). Registered
items can be put on the actual shopping list with a single tap. There
is also support for remembering one-time things that do not need to be
registered persistently.

You can get it by 

* downloading the source right here and launch it via Android Studio 
* installing [this apk](https://github.com/replrep/Einkaufszettel/blob/main/apk/Einkaufszettel-1.0.0.apk)

The main screen looks like this:

If you long-tap an item the edit dialog shows up:
